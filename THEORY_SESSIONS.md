# Edge AI Orientation and Hardware Primer


## AI on a Microchip - Edge Computing with VSDSquadron Pro RISC-V board
This is a way to use the existing AI tools to which can be used to implement on low power boards such as the VSDSquadronPro and help implement the architectures which can be transferred to AI based products with more new ideas

## Understanding you RISC-V board - Prerequisities to AI on 16KB RAM
1. Go through the Datasheet and the specification of the board
2. 320MHz of Clk speed: helps to understand how fast onferacnce will take time to run
3. 32MBit: Code and model should not exceed this space
4. 16KB of cache and : Every calculation should not exceed this data
5. Check what other specification means on the limit of the chip data processing and instruction set execution and the models that can be run on it
